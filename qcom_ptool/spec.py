"""
Internal representation shared by all input loaders.

Every loader (``loaders/conf.py`` today, ``loaders/yaml.py`` tomorrow) must
return a ``LoadedSpec`` so the rest of ``gen_partition.py`` is independent
of the source format.

``DiskParams`` and ``PartitionEntry`` are type aliases for ``dict[str, str]``
rather than ``TypedDict``s; the XML emitter passes the dicts straight to
``ET.SubElement(..., attrib=...)`` which requires a plain ``dict[str, str]``
at runtime, and aliasing keeps that contract precise without TypedDict's
``total=False`` ``object`` widening. Migrating to dataclasses (with explicit
``to_attrib()`` methods) is a clean follow-up if stronger validation becomes
worth its blast radius.
